# Filtering Properties of WPF PropertyGrid Through Events
## Overview
Filtering properties in a WPF PropertyGrid through event handling is a powerful technique that allows developers to dynamically control which properties are displayed at runtime. This is especially useful in scenarios where property visibility depends on:
- User interactions
- Application state
- Specific business logic

## Why Use Property Filtering?
Dynamic filtering enhances the user experience by keeping the interface clean and relevant. For example:
- Hide advanced settings from novice users
- Show additional configuration options only when a checkbox is selected
- Display properties based on user roles or permissions

## How It Works
By leveraging events such as PropertyFilterChanged, or by implementing custom logic tied to UI triggers, developers can intercept the property rendering process and apply filters based on:
- Property type
- Category
- Name
- Custom attributes
